			<h2>1.1 How and why we want to analyze the cryptocurrency developer community</h3>
			<p>Cryptocurrencies are maybe the most interesting economic phenomenon in recent years. Being able to basically generate money by running computer algorithms and doing very little work after an initial setup is a very tempting outlook for everybody. And even though the possible uses of bitcoin and co. to actually buy stuff from the real world are still limited, more and more people have jumped on the train of mining and trading with cryptocurrencies, resulting in huge value increases. In 2017 alone, the worth of bitcoin, the oldest, most common and most valuable cryptocurrency, has increased more than tenfold, eclipsing the 10,000$ mark on November 28th. This has lead to some interesting developments in recent time, such as prices for some computer hardware, especially powerful graphics cards, almost doubling in the last year.</p>
			<img src="images/bitcoin-pricechart.png" alt="Bitcoin pricechart">
			<p>But just as more and more people have begun to join the virtual gold rush and try their luck at mining bitcoins with their home equipment, other groups of programming enthusiasts and cryptology specialists have started to create alternatives to the almighty bitcoin, resulting in hundreds of more or less valuable virtual forms of money being available and ready to be mined. In order to do so, one has to get a piece of source code from the internet, which is most of the time stored on github.</p>
			<p>Github itself, again, is not only a way to share and collaborate on programmin projects, but also has functions that make it a social platform, such as the ability to follow another user or to "like" a certain project or code reporitory. This second act is called "stargazing" in github terms. And that's where data science and social graphs come into play. We want to find out, how the stargazer community of different cryptocurrencies is shaped. In order to do so, we need to get the necessary information about the code repositories via the github api and then analyze it with tools of network science.</p>
			<p>We also want to take a look at the Wikipedia entries of some cryptocurrencies and try to find differences in word choice, etc. Because most of the digital currencies are very new or small, the number of Wikipedia entries is very limited.</p>
			
			<p><span class="emphasis">TL;DR: We want to analyze the community of cryptocurrency enthusiasts on github and the corresponding Wikipedia pages. We want to do this, because it is a booming, highly discussed industry that could change the face of the financial world</span><p>
			<br>

			<h2>1.2 Dataset description</h2>
			<p>The dataset that we collected and analyzed contains the github repositories for over 300 cryptocurrencies and their stargazers. Also, we have information on which of the users that starred one of the repositories follow each other. The second piece of data are the Wikipedia pages to some of the aforementioned currencies.</p>
			<br>

			<a name='1.3'></a>
			<h2>1.3 Goals for user experience</h2>
			<p>With the website, we want to provide insight to several questions about the cryptocurrency community:
			<ul>
			<li><span class="emphasis">How is github relevance connected to a currency's market value?</span></li>
			<li><span class="emphasis">What are the similarities between several cryptocurrencies' following bases?</span></li>
			<li><span class="emphasis">Are there communities within the group of users starring cryptocurrency repositories?</span></li>
			<li><span class="emphasis">What can we gain from analyzing the Wikipedia pages of certain currencies?</span></li>
			</ul>
			</p>

			<h1>2. The data</h1>
			<a name='2.1'></a>
			<h2>2.1 Dataset collection and setup</h2>
			<h3>2.1.1 Stargazer network data collection</h3>
			<p>To gain an insight on which cryptocurrencies exist and where to find their source code, we first need a place to gain this information from. On <a href="http://www.coinmarketcap.com" target="_blank">coinmarketcap.com</a>, we can find all the cryptocurrencies' names.  We used web scraping to extract the names of over 1300 crpyto-currencies.</p>
			<p>As a next step, we need to find the actual github repositories for the currencies. The site <a href="http://www.coingecko.com" target="_blank">coingecko.com</a> allows us to get this information (Note that not all cryptocurrencies have github repositories, thus we will end up with a shorter list than before)</p>
			<p>We where successful in finding the repositories of over the vast majority of significant crypto-currency projects. For example in the top 50 crypto-currencies by marketcap only 4 do not have an active git repository.
			<br> 
			<p>These are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li style="display: list-item">Stellar-Lumens (no. 17 by market cap)</li><br>
				<li style="display: list-item">Byteball-btyes (no. 31 by market cap)</li><br>
				<li style="display: list-item">Metaverse-etp (no. 38 by market cap)</li><br>
				<li style="display: list-item">Vechain (no. 47 by market cap)</li>	
			</ul>
			<br>
			<p>Now we are finally ready to get the data we will be working with. By using the github API (a way to get data from GitHub) and the python package PyGithub we can get all the needed information about the cryptocurrencies' repositories.</p><br>
        	<h3>2.1.2 Stargazer network setup</h3>
        	<p>With the data we gained, we can now set up a network with the following properties:</p>
        	<ul>
        	<li style="display: list-item">Nodes can either be users or currencies. This is specified by a node attribute "Type"</li>
        	<li style="display: list-item">Edges are either of the type gazes (User-to-currency) or follows (user-to-user)</li>
        	</ul>


        	<br><br><br>
        	<h3>2.1.3 Add links between users</h3>
        	<p>Now that we know which users starred the cryptocurrencies, we can add connections between these, depending on which users follow a certain person on github. These connections will be represented in the graph as additional edges.</p>
			<p>An edge points from one github user to another if the user follows the other user on github.</p>
			Hence,
			<ul>
			<li style="display: list-item">edges representing a users "following" are pointing to the user. (from other users to the user)</li>
			<li style="display: list-item">edges representing a users "follows" are poining away from the user (from the user to their followers)</li>
			</ul><br><br>
			<p>By getting the users that a given user is following for every user in the network and intersecting this with the users already in the network (as as most of the users a user is following do not have starred any of the github communities) we will be able to create</p><br>
        	
        	<h3>2.1.4 Wikipedia entry collection</h3>
        	<p>The second set of data we are going to analyze are Wikipedia pages of cryptocurrencies. We can find a list of Wikipedia's pages about these <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cryptocurrencies">here</a>. After downloading it, we can find all the links to pages covering specific currencies.</p>
        	<p>We access each link to each specific crypto-currency, and then download the wikipedia page for the crypto-currency.</p>
        	<a name='2.2'></a><br>
  			<h2>2.2 Summary statistics and basic properties of the network</h2>
        	<h3>The stargazer part</h3>
        	<p>After collecting all our data, we can start looking into it. First, we need an overview of how big our stargazer network is</p>
        	<ul>
        		<li>The network has 390 crypto-currencies (representing 99.5%+ of the marketcap)
        		<li>The netork has 40821 GitHub users</li>
        		<li>The ne
